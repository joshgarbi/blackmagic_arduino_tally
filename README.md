# blackmagic_arduino_tally
code for arduino uno r3 to send analog signal to cameras from atem software control 

arduino must send signal to corresponding LED for the camera that is taken
v1 will only support 2 states (on & off). Each of 3 LEDs will either be red (live) or off (otherwise)
v1 will connect to pc over usb 2.0 to access blackmagic software and get the live input. 


I will supply all hardware for v1 -josh garbi
